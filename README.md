## AI Telegram Bot

This project provides a framework for building an AI-powered Telegram bot. 

**Features:**

* **Easy setup and configuration:** Get started quickly with a simple and intuitive setup process.
* **Modular design:** Easily add new commands and features with the bot's modular architecture.
* **AI integration:**  Leverage the power of AI for natural language understanding and intelligent responses (specific AI features are dependent on your implementation).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the bot:**
   * Obtain an API token from BotFather on Telegram ([https://t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)).
   * Create a `config.py` file based on `config.example.py` and replace placeholders with your information.

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```
   python bot.py
   ```

**Configuration (`config.py`):**

* **`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`:** Your Telegram bot's API token.

**Commands:**

* **`/start`:** Starts the bot and displays a welcome message.
* **`/help`:** Lists available commands and their descriptions.

**Extending the bot:**

You can easily add new commands and functionalities to the bot. Create new Python files in the `commands` directory and define functions decorated with `@bot.command()` to handle different commands. 

**Example Command:**
```python
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import CallbackContext

from bot import bot

@bot.command("echo")
def echo(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
    """Echoes the user's message."""
    update.message.reply_text(update.message.text)
```
